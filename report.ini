[ClearPass Cluster Details]
title=ClearPass Cluster Details
comment=This reports all the ClearPass appliances that had been involved in RADIUS authentications

[ClearPass Cluster Authentications per hour]
title=ClearPass Cluster Authentications per hour
comment=These highlights how the environment is operating. Concern arises where the background failure rate is excessive, in theory there should be none, this is not always possible. It is often dependent on the ClearPass service design - e.g. guest. Spikes are a concern and possibly a serious concern as it might indicate a serious short-term issue - e.g. an authentication source going offline. These should be investigated.

[Maximum License Usage]
title=Maximum License Usage
comment=These highlights the highest licenses used over the time frame of the report. If these are above the limit they will be highlighted in red - more licenses should be purchased. If these are within 10%% of the limit they will be highlighted in amber - it may be worth considering more licenses? If less than 50%% of licenses are being used they will be highlight in green - it might be worth reducing the supported number of licenses?

[Endpoint Status]
title=Endpoint Status
comment=This shows the number of endpoints that have connected in the time frame of the report. Disabled endpoints are a concern: They should be removed. Known endpoints: It is desirable to have all the endpoints in this state - but may be impossible, this is effectively an audit of the devices (as opposed to infrastructure) connecting to the network. Unknown endpoints: It is highly desirable to keep these to a minimum. However, with 'open' SSIDs (e.g. guests) and randomized MAC addresses may make this impossible.
comment2=Typically you wouldn't expect to see more that 1 successful authentication by a device every hour. Fails are another matter.
comment3=In this case the maximum authentications per hour (
comment4=) is massively above the total observed devices.
comment5=In this case the maximum authentications per hour (
comment6=) is noticeably above the total observed devices.

[Missing Known Endpoints]
title=Missing Known Endpoints
comment=This indicates the number of Known endpoints that have not connected in the time frame of the report. WARNING: This maybe misleading as the Insight database does not indicate whether a Known endpoint has been deleted.
#-- Problem is that many of the Insight tables don't have a concept of expiry or 
#-- age...
#-- This really needs a RESTful API direct to the ClearPass to get accurate count.
#-- 'threshold' is the number of ClearPass that above which will be reported 
#-- in red. Anything above 1/10 of this figure will be report amber 
threshold=100

[ClearPass Cluster Authentication Load Distribution]
title=ClearPass Cluster Authentication Load Distribution
comment=This graph may highlight poor distribution of authentications across the ClearPass cluster. However, this is very dependent on the cluster's architectural design. 
	If this is a master/hot-standby design you expect the load to be totally on the master and only transition to the hot-standby if the master has failed.
	If this was a distributed design one would expect the load to be evenly shared across all the ClearPass appliances. A quick visual inspection will indicate how well this is operating.

[Top ClearPass Cluster Events]
title=Top 10 ClearPass Cluster Events
comment=This reports the number of matching events and which ClearPass they occurred on. Error events are highlighted in red. Warning events are highlighted in red. Ultimately it is desirable to minimise these.
#-- Replace is used a anomylize the reported Event message. 
#-- Three variables are provided

[ClearPass Error Events per hour]
title=ClearPass Cluster Error Events per hour
comment=This graph summaries the ClearPass cluster's error events. Clearly any error events are not good, but may not be directly related to authentications. If these do correlate with increased authentication failures they should be investigate.
threshold=40

[ClearPass Error Events Burst Details]
title=ClearPass Cluster Error Events Burst Details
comment=These tables highlights the break down of events in key bursts

[Access License Usage over Time]
title=Access License Usage over Time
comment=These highlights when licenses are being used. If the report is over a long period of time it may indicate changes in network usage. Unexpected peaks may indicate malicious behaviour.

[Stale Access License Recovery]
title=Stale Access License Recover
comment=These are a count of 'stale' access licenses that are recovered overnight. An access license becomes 'stale' if after 24 hours ClearPass has not seen a RADIUS Accounting Interim or a RADIUS Accounting Stop. The session may still exist but ClearPass has no visibility or control over it.

#[Top ClearPass Cluster Alerts]
#title=Top 10 ClearPass Cluster Alerts
#comment1=Alerts are raised by Insight. Custom alerts can be created in Insight. Many alerts are really not helpful. It's better to filter for the Alerts you specifically want to see.

[Endpoint Categorization]
title=Endpoint Categorization
comment=This reports the top 10 endpoints of particular type. 
	Endpoints reported as 'No Fingerprint' are highlighted in red: These have not been fingerprinted - question is why? This could indicate lack of DHCP Request or no proactive scanning? 
	Endpoints reported as 'Generic' are highlighted in amber: These either have been fingerprinted purely on the OUI or the fingerprint is not recognised. If only an OUI why? If the fingerprint is not recognised best to feed this information back via Aruba TAC - they will update the fingerprint file appropriately (this is automatically loaded on the 1st or 15th of every month) Alternatively, manually create the appropriate fingerprint categorization.

[Endpoint IP Address Assignment]
title=Endpoint IP Address Assignment
comment=This reports the distribution between devices with static IP address and using DHCP. ClearPass assumes all devices have a static IP address and only makes the device 'DHCP' if it receives an associated DHCP Request relayed to ClearPass (usually). Generally, it is preferred to use dynamic IP addresses. Hence, if the Static IP count is greater than the DHCP count it is reported in amber. This could be an indication that there are excessive number of devices with a static IP address. Or that DHCP Requests are not being relayed to the ClearPass.
	DHCP is highly desirable that ClearPass receives DHCP Requests as it can use these to profile the device, and possibly identify spoofed devices. 
	Static IP addresses can be profile using SNMP, SSH, WMI, NMAP or device's HTTP user-agent (reliant on ClearPass seeing the web request). NMAP and user-agent are both very unreliable for fingerprint, but may be useful to identify specific usage or spoofing.

[Endpoint MAC & IP Address Details]
title=Endpoint MAC & IP Address Details
comment=This reports the number of devices that ClearPass knows - this is split in to three categories: 
	1) Devices with MAC address only: Possibly indicates that RADIUS Account is not working or the RADIUS Accounting is not populating the Framed-IP-Address. If the NAS does not support RADIUS Accounting with Framed-IP-Address ClearPass can be configured to read the appropriate ARP table (e.g. local access router) - using the suitable SNMP credentials. NOTE the default poll is once an hour, this can be tuned down to 10 minutes. But this is likely to be too slow for effective RESTful API upper-layer injection where the IP address is required (e.g. firewall). These are always highlighted in amber. Also NASs dealing with devices that have static IP addresses are likely to require special configuration to proactively set the Framed-IP-Address - some NAS do not support this or are slow at learning a static IP addresses.
	2) Devices with MAC and IP address: This is where we want everything. 
	3) Devices with IP address only: These are devices that typically have been learnt via a proactive scan (SNMP, SSH, WMI or NMAP) or via ClearPass observing the device's HTTP user-agent. These could be devices that are not being controlled by ClearPass? - these need checking.

[Endpoints with Randomized MAC Addresses]
title=Endpoints with Randomized MAC Addresses
comment=This is the total number of endpoints using randomized MAC addresses. Theoretically you should only see this on devices connecting to open SSID.

[Number of Suspected Spoofs Detected]
title=Number of Suspected Spoofs Detected
comment=Device spoofing is a serious concern. Though ClearPass' ability to detect them is not great. False positives are common. Likewise, many devices my be commissioned using PXE Boot - there is a setting to disable identifying these. Alternatively whitelist in this report's ini file.
#-- 'whitelist' this is a CSV list of MAC addresses to ignore

#-- Please treat accordingly!
title=10 Most Recent Spoof

[Authentications per Service]
title=Authentications per Service
comment=This orders the services based on the total number of authentications handled. It might be desirable to order the services so that the most commonly hit are near the top, though this is not likely to make much difference in performance.

[Top Failed Authentications per Service]
title=Top 15 Failed Authentications per Service
comment=This is based on the percentage failure. Anything about 50%% failure rate is highlighted in red. Above 25%% is highlighted in amber. These should be investigated to understand why such high failure rates. It is highly desirable to minimize failures.

[Top Endpoints not Matching a Service]
title=Top Endpoints not Matching a Service
